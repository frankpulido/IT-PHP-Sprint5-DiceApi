# OBJECTIVES

API : Program an access with tokens in Laravel Framework.

# ABOUT THE GAME API

The dice game is played with two dice. If the sum of the two dice is 7, the game is won, if not, it is lost. To be able to play the game, you must first be registered as a user in the application with a unique email and a nickname that must not be repeated between users or, if preferred, you can leave out any name and it will be called “Anonymous” by default. There can be more than one anonymous player. When creating a new user, a unique identifier and a registration date are assigned.

Each player can see a list of all the rolls they have made, with the value of each die and whether or not they have won the game. In addition, you can know their success percentage for all the rolls they have made.

You cannot delete a specific roll, but you can delete the entire list of rolls for a player.

The software must allow the application administrator to view all players in the system, see the success rate of each player, and the average success rate of all players in the system.

The software must respect the main design patterns.

## Add security

Include passport authentication on all accesses to the microservice URLs.

Define a role system and block access to different routes according to their privilege level.

## Testing

Create the unit tests for integration in the application. You will work by applying TDD to the application to test each of the routes.


## API ENDPOINTS

POST /players : create a player.
PUT /players/{id} : update player's name.
POST /players/{id}/games/ : player's throw dice, outcome gets stored in database.
DELETE /players/{id}/games: deletes ALL plays of a given player (full history) from database.
GET /players: returns ALL players and average success rate for each of them.
GET /players/{id}/games: returns the outcomes of ALL plays of a given player.
GET /players/ranking: returns the average success rate of ALL players... (not the same than average success rate of ALL throws).
GET /players/ranking/loser: returns player with LOWEST success rate.
GET /players/ranking/winner: returns player with HIGHEST success rate..

## DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT SETUP
1) Hardware : developed with an iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015). Processor : 3,3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7. Operating System : macOS Monterrey 12.7.6
2) Software :
- XAMPP (php and MariaDB)
- Laravel : implemented Bearer Token authentication with Sanctum.
- Postman
3) Database
- Development : MariaDB
- Testing : SQLite

Constrains : Sanctum instead of Passport.
I could not install Laravel Passport. My XAMPP php.ini (MacOS) doesn't allow to activate sodium extension, all extensions come pre-built in the package and sodium extension is non-existent in .so file.
I decided to move on with Sanctum instead.

## KISS PRINCIPLE

Sanctum offers the possibility to assign "abilities" to Tokens and require such abilities to access and endpoint. I considered that using this functionality only added unnecessary complexity to the api.
(I am coping with a tendency to develop over-engineered solutions).

## GITFLOW

I worked on main branch until I had prepared Models and Migrations.
Once having everything set to work with roles and token authentication I created the develop branch.

OK, here we go :
1/ auth-setup : prepare model User and controllers methods for Sanctum token and role check
2/ tdd : start with PHPUnit testing, starting by testing role restricted access to endpoints

main
└── develop
    ├── feature/auth-setup          (Sanctum + roles setup)
    ├── feature/tdd                 (prepare tdd for all controller methods)
    ├── feature/game-actions       (authenticated gamer actions : roll dice, show plays, delete plays, update name and/or nickname)
    └── feature/admin-statistics    (store, index, ranking, winner, loser)


### GITGLOW STRATEGY - WORKFLOW FOR SOLO DEVELOPER

FOR EACH feature/name branch :

Being on develop branch :
git checkout -b feature/name develop
(or just git checkout -b feature/name)

Branch is created and you auto checkout to it.

On feature/name branch :
1- git commit -m "commit description"
2- git push origin feature/name (first time : git push -u origin feature/name)
(repeat 1 and 2 as many times you want/need until ready to merge with develop)
3- git checkout develop

On develop branch
4- git merge feature/name
5- git push origin develop
6- git branch -d feature/name

The feature/name branch is kept intact on origin but deleted locally.
In case you need to work on same feature again :

7- git checkout -b feature/name develop
(branch feature/name is recreated)
8- Repeat process from 1 to 6

When recreating the feature branch with the same name and pushing it to origin (git push origin feature/name)

A ChatGPT advise :
Over time you accumulate stale remote-tracking branches locally. Clean them from time to time :
git fetch --prune


### GITGLOW STRATEGY - WORKFLOW FOR DEVELOPER'S TEAM

1- Update develop locally and create branch feature/name
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/name

2- Push feature/name branch to origin
git push -u origin feature/name

3- Develop and commit changes. Push to origin
git add .
git commit -m "Feature work"
git push

4- Merge feature/name into develope remotely
- Open Pull Request (PR) in GitHub
- Review, approve and merge the PR

5- Delete Feature Branch
git branch -d feature/name (Local)
git push origin --delete feature/name (Remote)

6- Update develop locally
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop


## REGARDING REGISTRY AND AUTHENTICATION (AuthController)

* Sign-up (register method) : No permission (no Bearer Token) needed for register in the app.
* Sign-in (login method) : Only registered users can log-in. A token is created in personal_access_token table.
A user can sign-in more than once and have several active tokens... User can log-in from several devices.
* Sign-out (logout method) : Only logged-in users can log-out (Bearer Token needed). When logging out ALL tokens are deleted from personal_access_token table. All devices connected are logged out.

Advantages:
- Enhanced security: By invalidating all tokens upon logout, the system ensures complete account security across all devices.
- Simplified token management: The server doesn't need to maintain multiple active tokens per user.
Drawbacks:
- User inconvenience: Users must re-authenticate on all devices after logging out from any single device.
- Potential disruption: Active sessions on other devices are terminated without warning.

Having both functions ("register" in AuthController and "store" in PlayerController) makes sense since they serve different purposes:

1. REGISTER in AuthController

    Purpose: Handles user registration via a public-facing form.
    Role: Typically, it:
        Validates user input.
        Creates a user account.
        Sends a confirmation email (if email verification is implemented).
    Scope: It’s used during initial user signup.

2. STORE in PlayerController

    Purpose: Handles creating new players, usually by an admin or an authenticated user with permission to access the endpoint.
    Role: Typically, it:
        Requires the user to be authenticated (e.g., an admin adding players).
        Assumes the email is already verified if email verification is implemented.
    Scope: It’s restricted to specific roles (e.g., admin).

Key Differences
Aspect	        REGISTER (AuthController)	        STORE (PlayerController)
Accessibility	Public-facing (unauthenticated)     Restricted to specific roles (e.g., admin)
Verification	Usually sends email confirmation	Assumes email is already verified
Use Case	    User signing up for the app         Admin creating new players


## PHP UNIT : FEATURE TESTS

The migrations of the production environment are set for MariaDB. The testing environment is set for SQLite.

AuthControllerTest:
    Repeats user registration and token creation for each test.
    Prioritizes test independence over DRY.

AdminControllerTest:
    Uses setUp for centralized user and token creation.
    Prioritizes DRY while reusing shared setup for all tests.

PlayControllerTest :
    Uses.
    Prioritizes.
